# Objective: Create a deployment data file that conforms to Movebank data standards. Identify and rename duplicate IDs (signifying collar redployments) so that each animal ID is unique.

# Add, rename, and transform columns to conform to Movebank attributes
# Use _ instead of - because R doesn't like dashes

# Add sensor_type column to differentiate between GPS, VHF, and visual only. Add animal_taxon column.

# Split Collar_Deployment_Notes into animal_comments and deployment_end_comments depending on nature of comments. 
# Add deployment_end_type: if Notes indicate Mortality, code as "dead", otherwise NA.

# Relabel redeploys to avoid duplicate animal IDs. This is achieved by the code chunk that starts with group_by() and ends at ungroup(). If length of Collar_Serial group > 1, add letter suffixes "a", "b" to the existing Collar_Serial number. For all Collar_Serials, add an "M" so that the column does not get read as numeric during export/import.

# Drop extraneous columns: "Collar_Deployment_ID","Collar_Deployment_Notes","Collar_Serial"

# Not sure about the differences between animal, deployment, and tag ID.
