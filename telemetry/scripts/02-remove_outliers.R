#### Load data and packages----
rm(list = ls())

library(tidyverse)
library(move)
library(ctmm)

load("output/gps_clean_all.Rdata")
source("scripts/function-subsetIDTimeLags.R")

#### Convert to Movebank object----
# According to Vectronic manual (https://vectronic-aerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Manual_GPS-Plus-Collar-Manager-V3.11.3.pdf), Lat/Long is in WGS84. 
# Required for calculating timeLags

gpsMove <- move(x=gpsData$longX,y=gpsData$latY,
                time=gpsData$datetime,
                data=gpsData,proj=CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"),
                animal=gpsData$deployment_id, sensor="gps")

# show(gpsMove)
# show(split(gpsMove))
n.indiv(gpsMove) # no of individuals
n.locs(gpsMove) # no of locations per individuals

# Explore data for outliers----
# See vignette: https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/articles/error.html
# This is always so hacky & iterative, and I never have a good workflow for this
# 
# 1. Check location outliers. 
# 2. Check time lags. Fix rate is 2 hours- find instances where fix rate is much smaller/larger. A lot of the times the problems stem from unidentified redeployments (though this should have been addressed in previous script) or collar issues at the start/end of deployment
# 3. Investigate outliers manually. Consider: 1- Missed fixes, 2- Impossible speeds or distances, 3- Impossible locations

# Location outliers----

plot(gpsData$longX, gpsData$latY, xlab="Longitude", ylab="Latitude")

summary(gpsData) 

# Will tackle other, less noticeable location outliers on a case-by-case basis later

#### Check for outlying fix rates----

# Calculate time lags between locations
timeLags <- move::timeLag(gpsMove, units='hours')
ids <- unique(gpsData$deployment_id)

# Generate plots and quantitative summary
lagSummary <- data.frame(row.names = ids)

for (i in 1:length(ids)){
  timeL <- timeLags[[i]]
  
  lagSummary$id[i] <- ids[i]
  lagSummary$min[i] <- min(timeL)
  lagSummary$mean[i] <- mean(timeL)
  lagSummary$sd[i] <- sd(timeL)
  lagSummary$max[i] <- max(timeL)
  
  hist(timeL,main=ids[i],xlab="Hours")
  plotName <- paste("timeLags",ids[i],sep="")
  filePath <- paste("output/plots/",plotName,sep="")
  finalName <- paste(filePath,"png",sep=".")
  dev.copy(png,finalName)
  dev.off()
  
}

rm(plotName,filePath,finalName,i,timeL)
