# Distances are within the range shown in the vignette, where the individuals are considered as 'relatively range resident'

# Plot variograms
varioPlot(gpsData)

# Many of the zoomed in plots are non-linear, indicating continuity in the animal's velocity (from variogram vignette)
# We can fit a linear model like OU to see by how much we would need to coarsen our timescale for use in common analytical methods like SSF
# internal numbers in ctmm use SI units of meters and seconds
# Random gaps in the data are acceptable and fully accounted for in both variogram estimation and model fitting

# Use ctmm.guess (=variogram.fit) to obtain initial "guess" parameters, which can then be passed onto to ctmm.fit
# Use ctmm.select to choose top-ranked model, which will be used to generate aKDEs
# Do not use ctmm.fit - ctmm.fit() returns a model of the same class as the guess argument i.e. an OUF model with anisotropic covariance.
