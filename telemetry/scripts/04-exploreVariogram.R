# Objective: Plot and look at variograms to explore space use patterns. Preliminary step before fitting a movement model and generating an aKDE

# Prepare and explore data----
# Convert to telemetry object
# Stick with default projection for now, but may want to switch to a user-defined proj. with origin around Nushagak River: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/118125/proj4js-is-this-correct-implementation-of-azimuthal-equidistant-relative-to-an
gpsData <- ctmm::as.telemetry(mooseData)

# Plot tracks
# Distances are within the range shown in the vignette, where the individuals are considered as 'relatively range resident'
plot(gpsData,col=rainbow(length(gpsData)))

# Plot variograms----
varioPlot(gpsData)

# Many of the zoomed in plots are non-linear, indicating continuity in the animal's velocity (from variogram vignette)
# We can fit a linear model like OU to see by how much we would need to coarsen our timescale for use in common analytical methods like SSF
# internal numbers in ctmm use SI units of meters and seconds
# Gaps in the data are acceptable and fully accounted for in both variogram estimation and model fitting. Shouldn't be an issue for us since we interpolated to create a regular time series
