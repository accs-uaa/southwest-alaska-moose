# Objective: Summarize point-level variables as the mean for each path. Exclude random paths that have more than 10 points in a lake. Randomly select 10 paths from the subset of the "lake-free" random paths for use in statistical modeling.

#### Summarize data ----
# Calculate mean for every variable of interest

  dplyr::group_by(mooseYear_id,fullPath_id) %>%

# Calculate total number (sum) of points that are in a lake

# Join lakeSum with meanPaths

# Select 10 random paths 

# Exclude random paths in lake
# Use observed paths to determine threshold of exclusion
# For every path, calculate total number of points that are in a lake
meanPaths %>% dplyr::filter(response=="1") %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(lake_sum),max=max(lake_sum))

# Mean number of points in lake for observed paths is 0.338, max is 3.

# Exclude random paths that have more than 3 points in a lake and select 10 random paths for every observed path.

# Check that there are 10 random paths for each ID
randomPaths %>% 
  dplyr::count(mooseYear_id) %>% 
  filter (n<10)

# Check that the mean # of points in a lake is +/- similar to the mean for observed paths (0.338)
randomPaths %>% ungroup %>% dplyr::summarise(mean = mean(lake_sum),max=max(lake_sum))
# Mean for random paths is 0.32 lake points/path.

# Create final dataset that includes 10 random paths and 1 observed path
allPaths <- meanPaths %>% 
  dplyr::filter(response=="1") %>% 
  rbind(randomPaths)
# Should have 880 rows (80 observed + 80*10 random)
