# Objective: For every cow, create a variable "Boolean Parturience" that tracks the survival of calves during calving season. This variable will be used to develop separate models for a) females with calf-at-heel (birthing sites) and b) females without calves. For now, we treat twins or triplets as single boolean Calf-At-Heel. If one calf of a twin set dies, then the cow remains in Calf-At-Heel (1) status. We may add a variable of # of calves in the future.
# We drop observations of pregnant cows that have not yet given birth. These observations were originally coded as 0s, but we recoded them as 3s in MS Excel to make it easy to drop them here. The reason we drop them is because we do not want to conflate the movement patterns/vegetation selection of females on their way to birthing site to females with calf-at-heel (if coded as 1) or to females with dead/no calf (at or on their way to foraging sites).
