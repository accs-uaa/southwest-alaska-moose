# Objective: Examine GPS data for issues: outliers, duplicates, and skips.

#### Load data and packages----
rm(list = ls())
source("package_TelemetryFormatting/init.R")
source("package_TelemetryFormatting/function-subsetIDTimeLags.R")

load("pipeline/telemetryData/gpsData/02_formatData/formattedData.Rdata")

#### Calculate time lags----
# According to Vectronic manual (https://vectronic-aerospace.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Manual_GPS-Plus-Collar-Manager-V3.11.3.pdf), Lat/Long is in WGS84.
# Convert to move object
# Required for calculating timeLags
# Use Easting/Northing as coordinates

gpsMove <- move(x=gpsData$Easting,y=gpsData$Northing,
                time=gpsData$datetime,
                data=gpsData,proj=CRS("+init=epsg:3338"),
                animal=gpsData$deployment_id, sensor="gps")

# Will throw a warning if there are any records with NA as coordinates

# show(gpsMove)
# show(split(gpsMove))
n.indiv(gpsMove) # no of individuals
n.locs(gpsMove) # no of locations per individuals

# Explore data for outliers----
# See vignette: https://ctmm-initiative.github.io/ctmm/articles/error.html
#

# 1. Check time lags- missed fixed rates or duplicates. Fix rate is 2 hours. In this data set, most problems stem from unidentified redeployments (addressed in previous script) and collar issues at the start/end of deployment
# 2. Check movement outliers including:
#         a) improbable speeds
#         b) improbable distances
#         c) improbable locations

# Plot coordinates
# Takes a while to load
plot(gpsData$Easting, gpsData$Northing,
     xlab="Easting", ylab="Northing")

summary(gpsData)

# Will tackle other, less noticeable location outliers on a case-by-case basis later

#### Check for time lag/fix rate issues----

# Calculate time lags between locations
timeLags <- move::timeLag(gpsMove, units='hours')
ids <- unique(gpsMove@trackId)

# Generate plots and quantitative summary
timelagSummary <- data.frame(row.names = ids)

for (i in 1:length(ids)){
  timeL <- timeLags[[i]]

  timelagSummary$id[i] <- ids[i]
  timelagSummary$min[i] <- min(timeL)
  timelagSummary$mean[i] <- mean(timeL)
  timelagSummary$sd[i] <- sd(timeL)
  timelagSummary$max[i] <- max(timeL)

  hist(timeL,main=ids[i],xlab="Hours")
  plotName <- paste("timeLags",ids[i],sep="")
  filePath <- paste("pipeline/telemetryData/gpsData/03a_cleanFixRate/temp/",plotName,sep="")
  finalName <- paste(filePath,"png",sep=".")
  dev.copy(png,finalName)
  dev.off()

}

rm(plotName,filePath,finalName,i,timeL)

# Collars with time lag issues----

# Basically all of them have problems.
